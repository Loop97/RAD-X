This app is only able to function if you have the Radiation Detector with you.
You may be able to register an account and view the radiation readings recorded by other users, but you will not be able to record or send data to the database.

The app was coded using Flutter for cross platform deployment (Appstore and Google Play Store).
It is using the DART framewrok and has been intergrated with Firebase for it's data storage.
This app is a collaboration with my teammate, otakenz(Github profile).

This project was conducted under the internship at Singapore Nuclear Research and Safety Initiative,(SNRSI). This code was delivered to them, and they have the right to alter and further develop future versions of this app.
